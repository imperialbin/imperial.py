## API Token

An API Token is not required, but you can't do most things without one. Add `IMPERIAL_TOKEN` to path to set it
automatically; this will get overwritten by setting one manually.

## Example Usage

Shorthand Functions are more optimal if you have your API token set as an environmental variable.

### Shorthand Functions

```python
import imperial_py

document = imperial_py.create_document("Hello, World!")
# document.content is "Hello, World!"
document.edit("Hello from Python!")
# document.content is "Hello from Python!"
document.delete()
# document is deleted off imperial servers,
# but information about the document still lives in the object
document.edit("This will raise an error!")
# imperial_py.exceptions.DocumentNotFound("We couldn't find that document!")
```

### Imperial Class

```python
from imperial_py import Imperial

imp = Imperial("IMPERIAL-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000")
document = imp.create_document("Hello, World!")
# etc...
```
